#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The first level would be O(n), the number of operations would increase proportionally with regards to the input size

b) The next level would be O(nlogn) because rthe output grows atg a slightly faster rate than O(n) but not as fast as O(n^2)


c)The last level would be O(n), the number of operations would increase proportionally with regards to the input size

## Exercise II

You would have to check if the egg breaks when thrown, if it does, then the floor would be greater than or equal to f. If it doesn't break then the floor is less than f. The total runtime of this operation would be log2n.
